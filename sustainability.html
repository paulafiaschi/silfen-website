      <h2>sustainability</h2>
      <p>Since day one, we have launched various initiatives to keep our carbon footprint to an absolute minimum as well
        as making conscious decisions concerning the social impact on the communities in the countries, in which we
        operate.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of 2020 we presented the brand under a new name “SILFEN”. We believe that this small change further
        represents
        a new and greener future for <strong>SILFEN</strong>. We always strive to deliver high quality products in
        better materials.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a company with great manufacturing activities, we know that we have a responsibility. Our focus is to make as
        green a production as possible, and we will continue to launch new initiatives to lower our carbon footprint
        even
        further.</p>

        <h5>Less consumption of water in our production</h5>
        <p>We make an effort to decrease the negative impact on the environment and to ensure local access to clean
          water.
          <br>
          We introduced a rPET or Recycled Polyethylene Terephthalate. This recycled material is primarily made from
          plastic waste collected from the oceans.

        <h5>Environmentally friendy shipping</h5>
        <p>We are in close contact with other brands in our aim to minimize shipping as much as possible – by joining
          forces.
          <br>
          We strive to ship as much as possible in bulk – mostly by sea or train. These are the most environmentally
          friendly modes of shipping, reducing polluting emissions.

        <h5>Fair labour</h5>
        <p>It is not only the environment, we must care for, but also the people who build our products from scratch. We
          believe that it is our job to amplify a healthy and socially responsible conduct within our organization,
          including all our suppliers.
          <br>
          We visit our manufacturers regularly to ensure that they follow the issued principles regarding working
          conditions, quality, pollution etc. This allows us to promise our customers that a SILFEN bag is always
          crafted in a responsible manner.
